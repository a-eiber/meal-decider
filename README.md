## General Information
- This is meant for people, mainly living in Queens, who canâ€™t decide on what to eat. 
- Using this program, it will randomly decide for you.


## Technologies Used
- Visual Studio Code
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Git Bash
- Codecademy


## Features
- Types of food include: Italian, American, Chinese, Mexican, and Sushi
- Neighborhoods include: Brooklyn, Queens, Nassau, Upper Manhattan, and Downtown Manhattan
- Price ranges include: Cheap, Average, and Expensive


## Setup
1. Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/ "Node.js Homepage")
2. Clone this repo onto your computer
3. While inside the directory you saved the file in, run the program using the command `node script.js`.
   - I personally used Git Bash but you can use whatever client you'd like to run a .js file.


## Usage
After running the program, it will say something like this:
`So, you can't decide what to eat. Well, don't worry, I'll tell you:`
`You should go to an expensive Chinese restaurant in Downtown Manhattan.`

You should then go to an expensive Chinese restaurant in Downtown Manhattan and enjoy yourself.

Here's another example:
`So, you can't decide what to eat. Well, don't worry, I'll tell you:`
`You should go to a cheap Italian restaurant in Upper Manhattan.`

You should then go to a cheap Italian restaurant, probably a pizza shop, in Upper Manhattan.

## Project Status
Project is: _complete_


## Room for Improvement
- I could add more types of restaurants and more specific neighborhoods
- I could let the user decide which borough they live in and then have the program pick neighborhoods only in that borough


## Acknowledgements
- I made this program as part of Codecademy's "Mixed Messages" portfolio project.
- Thank you Codecademy.
